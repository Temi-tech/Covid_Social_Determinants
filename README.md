Project Description: 

This project used a variety of data visualization and modeling efforts to answer my main research question:
What, if any, are the socially deterministic drivers of Covid prevalence and mortality? 
How do these drivers affect Covid infection and death rates?

This project contained my main paper, PowerPoint presentation, and code (in both Jupyter and R). 
It also has a folder for the data I cleaned (Data_I_Cleaned), csvs I used to make the choropleths, 
and csvs I generated from my running my Jupyter code. 
```
Csvs_for_choropleths: Folder with csvs which I used to make my choropleths (needed region, value format for R)

Data_I_Cleaned: Folder with data I pulled from my sources as listed in the final paper

Main.xlsx: Main excel sheet generated after pulling from my sources, what I read into Jupyter

main_all_counties.csv: Predecessor of select_counties_csv, 
result of cleaning main.xls as a Pandas dataframe in Jupyter, some values missing

Oshinowo_choropleths.pdf:  R pdf with code for making choropleths 

Oshinowo_choropleths.rmd: R markdown code which made the choropleths 

Oshinowo_Choropleths_Discussion.pdf: Discussion on choropleth maps 

Oshinowo_Code_Final_Research_Project.pdf: Jupyter Code in PDF format

Oshinowo_Final_Research_Project.inpyb: Jupyter file with code 

Oshinowo_Paper_Final_Research_Project.pdf: Final Paper
